npm start
```

This project was created using create-elm-app and then ejected, the original readme can be found [here](./docs/create-elm-app.md)

# Formatting

This project uses elm-format which works with the Visual Studio Code elm extension.

In order for the extension to format elm properly, you'll need to install elm-format globally on npm like so

```
npm install -g elm-format
```

If you're running on a mac and using npm 5, you'll have to download the latest [latest release of elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/releases) and copy the bin to `/usr/local/bin`
